# RimworldSaveCleaner

Clears world pawns in Rimworld A16 savegames. Very crude and untested (was hacked together in a few minutes, because the game was getting too slow).

## Known bugs

* Will remove all corpses from the map. This will in turn lead to exceptions. However after the errors when initially loading the savegame all seems fine afterwards.
